###  Hi, I’m Humaiara Diea.<br>
---  As an artist, I initially wanted to create a space to showcase my work. Being naturally drawn to building things from scratch, I decided to make my own website. That curiosity led me   down the rabbit hole of coding — what started as a simple idea turned into a passion I couldn’t walk away from. Now, I’m just as excited to build with code as I am with a paintbrush.<br>
--- Love creating apps things using technology.
